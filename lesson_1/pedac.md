**Understanding the Problem**

- Establish the rules / define the boundaries of the problem
  - Assessing all available information
  - Restate explicit requirements
  - Identify implicit requirements (ask questions and define terms)
- Spend enough time. Don't rush this step.

restate problem/rules/boundaries in bullet points

---
**Examples and Test Cases**

- Can confirm or refute assumptions
- Help answer questions about implicit requirements
- Act as assertions which help to codify the rules and boundaries

----

**Data Structures**

- Help to reason with data logically
- Help interact with data at implementation level
- Thinking about data structures is past of the problem solving process
- Data structures are closely linked to algorithms (a set of steps from input to output. Generally invoves structuring data in a certain way)

---

**Algorithm**

- A logical sequence of steps for accomplishing a task or objective
  - Closely linked to data structures
  - Series of steps to structure data to produce the required output
- Stay abstract and high-level
  - Avoid implementation detail
  - Don't worry about efficiency for now

- add substeps as needed or extract a step to a separate problem
